
AUTOMATA PROGRAMMING:

DFA:


1. Write a automata code for the Language that accepts all and only those strings that contain 001
2. Write a automata code for L(M) ={ w | w has an even number of 1s}
3. Write a automata code for L(M) ={0,1}*
4. Write a automata code for L(M)=a + aa*b.
5. Write a automata code for L(M)={(ab)n | n ∈ N}
6. Write a automata code for Let Σ = {0, 1}. 
                Given DFAs for {}, {ε}, Σ*, and Σ+.



NFA: 


1. Write a automata code for the Language that accepts all end with 01
2. Write a automata code for L(M)= a + aa*b + a*b.
3. Write a automata code for Let Σ = {0, 1}. 
        Given NFAs for {}, {ε}, {(ab)n | n ∈ N}, which has regular expression (ab)*.
