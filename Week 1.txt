


1. Develop a python program using decision control structure find the leap years between the
year limit 2000 to 2025. 

Code:
year = 2000
for year in range(2000,2025): if(year%4==0):
if(year%100==0 and year%400==0):
print ("{0} is a leap year\n".format(year))






else:
print ("{0} is a leap year\n".format(year))





  

2. Develop a python program to check the given number is Armstrong number or not using
iteration control structures. 

Code:
num = 153
sum = 0 temp = num


while temp > 0:
digit = temp % 10 sum += digit ** 3 temp //= 10


if num == sum:
print(num,"is an Armstrong number") else:
print(num,"is not an Armstrong number")





  



3. Solve the towers of Hanoi problem using recursive function in python language (n=3
discs) 

Code:
def TowerOfHanoi(n , source, destination, auxiliary): if n==1:
print ("Move disk 1 from source",source,"to destination",destination) return
TowerOfHanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, destination)
print ("Move disk",n,"from source",source,"to destination",destination) TowerOfHanoi(n-1, auxiliary, destination, source)


n = 3 TowerOfHanoi(n,'A','B','C')



  

4. Develop a python code declare the function swap and perform swapping operation of two
numbers without using temp variables.

 Code:
def swap(a, b):




a = a + b




b = a - b




a = a - b




print("After Swapping: a = ", a, ", b = ", b)




a = 5
b = 10




swap(a, b) 




 
5. Develop a python program which should have all function prototypes to perform any four
arithmetic operations. 

Code:
def add(num1,num2):
print ("the sum of {0} and {1} is {2}".format(num1,num2,num1+num2))




def sub(num1,num2):
print ("the sub of {0} and {1} is {2}".format(num1,num2,num1-num2))




def mul(num1,num2):
print ("the mul of {0} and {1} is {2}".format(num1,num2,num1*num2))




def div(num1,num2):
print ("the div of {0} and {1} is {2}".format(num1,num2,num1/num2))




num1 = 10
num2 = 5




add(num1,num2) sub(num1,num2) mul(num1,num2) div(num1,num2)
